Neura is a study in understanding the evolution of the self.
By recording frequent thoughts, observations, and ideas, we essentially build temporal profiles of the user[s] which can then be interacted with [in real time.]

The Neura insights feature allows the users to have a look at mental data, i.e. statistics that help understand happiness, stress, anxiety, and depressive tendencies better.

We are also rolling out the consciousness stream which will build a long-term understanding of what the user's goals have been, to what extent they have reached those goals, and serve as a semi-reminder to keep them on track. This will be built on the so-called unconscious or semi-conscious stream of thought.
