A web application which is basically a precursor to the aiNA project. What we aim to do here is collect byte sized data from users about their "day".
This will mostly be numbers and text data. The idea is to feed all of this to some model and generate insights about things like happiness, stress etc.

Functionalit(ies): Questions to be asked: Describe today in a sentence. How many times did you feel like smashing a wall? (On a scale of 1 to 10)
How many times did you feel like dancing with said wall? How much did you exercise? Did you feel that you were too stressed today? What was your diet and
food intake like today? Did you do anything that isn't part of your regular day today? Relfections

Maybe we can add some more. We also keep this frq so that we can get some more data.

Insights: Your happiness card: basically create a overall satisfaction/happiness score for each day’s worth of data and collated it temporally.
Stressor: The same thing but with respect to anxiety and stress. Somehow take into account contextual stress levels vs a ever prevalent pervasive
non reactive level of stress. Find a correlation between the things like food, sleep, exercise, amount of work done, socialisation etc etc to the previous two things.
Also below each graph have some sort of a pointer to explain and or help further enhance or retract whatever the current levels of the variable are. Finally, we have
(after each “day’s” entry), a “Your day was like insert character from mad max. Blah blah generate this”

List of things to be added going forward:

1. The Calender Featurette on the Home Page.
2. The Chat Functionality (which is literally what this project was about)
3. In the insights section:
   a) Check for inconsistencies in the stream of consciousness.
   b) Remind the user about things that they planned to do or how they have deviated from the
   actions that they wished to undertake.
   c) And of course, a listing of the "problems" they have been facing and their potential solutions.
4. Completion of the lander. Making it more informative about we are doing.
5. Designing pages for about us, contact us and AI.
6. If this turns out to be good, adding user AUTH and deployment.
